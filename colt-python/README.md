# Colt Python

This is a sound pack of various operations on a colt python.  This is my first attempt at something like this so YMMV.

## Equipment

- Firearm: Colt Python 6" Stainless (2020+)
- Speedloader: HKS A-Series Colt Python
- Audio Chain: Austrian Audio OC818 (Mic) -> Audient EVO4 (Interface)

## Software

- Reaper 7.x
- iZotope RX Standard
- UAD Plugins
- Fabfilter Q3

## Project Structure

- Export - Rendered files that should be ready to use
- Media - The raw audio that the reaper project (colt-python.RPP) consumes.
- colt-python.RPP - A reaper project used to generate the Export folder.

## Mechanics

- When using the ejector rod it is good practice to push in then release it quickly by sliding the digit off.  You also need to tip the gun vertical otherwise you will have a bad time.
- The cylindar release is pulled back to open the cylinder latch.
- In double action the hammer does not travel back as far compared to single action (this actually caused light primer strikes on earlier models).
- The cylindar rotates clockwise from the shooters perspective.  So a round in the upper left will advance into the firing position.
- The cylinder is locked after firing.  So to spin the cylinder you need to cock the hammer slightly or open and close the cylinder.  The cylinder will relock automatically when spun into place.
