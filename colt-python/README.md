# Colt Python

## Equipment

- Firearm: Colt Python 6" Stainless (2020+)
- Speedloader: HKS A-Series Colt Python
- Holster: Diamond-D Denali Chest Holster
- Microphone: Austrian Audio OC818
- Interface: Audient EVO4

## Mechanics

- When using the ejector rod it is good practice to push in then release it quickly by sliding the digit off.
- The cylindar release is pulled back to open the cylinder latch.
- In double action the hammer does not travel back as far compared to single action (this actually caused light primer strikes on earlier models).
- The cylindar rotates clockwise from the shooters perspective.  So a round in the upper left will advance into the firing position.
- The cylinder is locked after firing.  So to spin the cylinder you need to cock the hammer slightly or open and close the cylinder.  The cylinder will relock automatically when spun into place.
