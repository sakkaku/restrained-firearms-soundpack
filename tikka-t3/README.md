## Project Structure

- Export - Rendered files that should be ready to use
- Media - The raw audio that the reaper project consumes.
- tikka-t3.RPP - A reaper project used to generate the Export folder.

## Mechanics

- Capacity: 3, 5 round OEM magazines.  10 round aftermarket is available but extend out a great deal as they are still single stack.
- Hammer is recocked on bolt open after firing.
- Safety prevents the bolt from being operated when engaged.
- The magazine is detachable and you cannot reload the magazine without detaching it as the feed lips force the round to be inserted from the front.
